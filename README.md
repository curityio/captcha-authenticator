# Google reCAPTCHA v2 Authenticator Plugin Example #

This is a sample Authenticator plugin for the Curity Identity Server.

It demonstrates how to build a simple plugin that can be used to authenticate via Google's reCAPTCHA v2. Please note
that this should only be used combined with another authenticator such as the HTML form authenticator, as the
reCAPTCHA alone does not provide a subject (i.e. a user) but merely confirms whether the form was submitted by a human.
